Firstly, download all files from the WebApplication_SQLServer folder and place them in local folder C:\Scripts.

Open PowerShell as Administrator and run the below commands:

Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope CurrentUser

Unblock-File C:\Scripts\Stage1_InstallPrerequsites.ps1

Unblock-File C:\Scripts\Stage2_ConfigureApps.ps1

Then run the scripts (still running PowerShell as administrator) using the below commands. The scripts may require restarts and re-runs. It is safe to re-run the scripts until everything is installed/setup correctly.

& C:\Scripts\Stage1_InstallPrerequsites.ps1

& C:\Scripts\Stage2_ConfigureApps.ps1
